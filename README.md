## Files included
This website uses the Phapper reddit API PHP wrapper. The license and readme for Phapper are included in the relevant directory.

You can't download and run this code successfully. I have omitted a file in the /Phapper directory with the configuration settings for Phapper, which included usernames, passwords, API secrets etc.
